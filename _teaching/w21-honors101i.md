I co-taught this course for upper-level undergraduate students pursuing a long-term (generally, year-long) research project in Winter 2021. The course provided students with the research skills necessary to tackle their projects and used contract grading to help them devise (with guidance) a path of study to pursue adequate progress on their project and project plan within the 10-week quarter.
