The Community Workshop Series (CWS; [cws.web.unc.edu](https://cws.web.unc.edu)) is a partnership between UNC's School of Information & Library Science (SILS) and three local libraries to offer vital digital literacy skills to local community members.

As the coordinator for the program, I developed programming to train our students who wanted to teach our classes, and I worked with students who were teaching classes to improve their teaching. I also developed a few new classes for CWS and worked to improve the curricula for various classes that we offer.
