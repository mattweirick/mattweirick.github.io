As an intern in Research & Education at the Duke University Medical Center Library & Archives I provided reference and information services via phone, email, chat, and other communication media, I edited and contributed to LibGuides, including the one on [scientific writing](https://guides.mclibrary.duke.edu/scientificwriting), and  I wrote several blog posts on topics such as [Scholars@Duke and Elements](https://mclibrary.duke.edu/about/blog/2017-03-03/scholarsduke-publication-features-elements), [preparing citations from EndNote](https://mclibrary.duke.edu/about/blog/2017-04-24/preparing-citations-endnote-apa-ama-chicago-styles), and [common grammar mistakes](https://mclibrary.duke.edu/about/blog/2017-05-24/common-grammar-mistakes). Additionally, I made a [tutorial](http://gots.mclibrary.duke.edu/tutorial/h-index) to help Duke researchers find their h-indices in Scopus, and I worked with a group of colleagues to create a History of Medicine [kiosk exhibit](https://static.mclibrary.duke.edu/history-of-medicine/).
