00:00:01,00 --> 00:00:04,00
[SLIDE 1] Okay. Welcome. In this lightning talk, I’ll be giving a brief overview 

2
00:00:04,03 --> 00:00:08,00
of UCLA Library’s Anti-Racist Pedagogy Workshop Series, 

3
00:00:08,03 --> 00:00:13,00
which launched with our first workshop on 27 April 2021 (yay!). 

4
00:00:13,03 --> 00:00:19,00
[SLIDE 2] The Teaching & Learning Functional Team is part of UCLA Library’s User Engagement matrixed structure. 

5
00:00:19,03 --> 00:00:24,00
The team is currently made up of 10 members with rotating leadership and rotating membership. 

6
00:00:24,03 --> 00:00:32,00
It currently includes 8 members from User Engagement, a librarian from the Digital Library Program, and a librarian from Library Special Collections. 

7
00:00:32,03 --> 00:00:40,00
One of the central points of our charge is to promote professional development and reflective instructional practices for Library staff. 

8
00:00:40,03 --> 00:00:50,00
In the past, this has included a series of Remote Teaching Design Jams and Open Mic events that provide opportunities for professional development & skill-sharing. 

9
00:00:50,03 --> 00:00:56,00
[SLIDE 3] In the wake of George Floyd’s murder and as a result of Black-led activism demanding systemic change, 

10
00:00:56,03 --> 00:01:04,00
we experienced a period of increased institutional support for anti-racist work, in which the Teaching & Learning Functional Team 

11
00:01:04,03 --> 00:01:11,00
considered ways that we could support anti-racist practice in library instruction with three primary stipulations: 

12
00:01:11,03 --> 00:01:16,45
1) our approach should center and support BIPOC colleagues, students, staff, and faculty, 

13
00:01:16,48 --> 00:01:25,00
2) our intervention should be sustained and meaningful rather than a parachute effort like a one-off workshop or reading list, and 

14
00:01:25,03 --> 00:01:31,00
3) we would recognize the limits of our own expertise and identify experts to help fill these gaps. 

15
00:01:31,03 --> 00:01:35,36
One of the resulting initiatives was this Anti-Racist Pedagogy Workshop Series. 

16
00:01:35,39 --> 00:01:44,00
[SLIDE 4] Our goal for the workshop series is to invite qualified facilitators and experts to present on anti-racist pedagogy and practice 

17
00:01:44,03 --> 00:01:55,00
in a series available to all library staff to support anti-racist praxis in teaching & learning in alignment with the Library’s broader anti-racism initiative framework.

18
00:01:55,03 --> 00:02:05,00 
In order to provide a scaffolded and sustained engagement with anti-racist praxis and to ensure effective professional development and growth, 

19
00:02:05,03 --> 00:02:12,00
we had originally planned 6-8 sessions with invited speakers from September 2020 to June 2021.

20
00:02:12,03 --> 00:02:21,00
For reasons, we currently plan to offer 3 sessions (one per month) from April 2021 to June 2021. 

21
00:02:21,03 --> 00:02:29,46
Additionally, recognizing income disparities, material conditions, and the time and labor asked of our presenters and facilitators,

22
00:02:29,49 --> 00:02:34,00
it was important for our team to secure funding to provide some compensation. 

23
00:02:34,03 --> 00:02:42,00
So, we are able to provide $500 for each of our speakers thanks to our Associate University Librarian.

24
00:02:42,03 --> 00:02:46,00 
We hope that this is helpful for our speakers and shows our gratitude for their work.

25
00:02:46,03 --> 00:02:48,00
[SLIDE 5] Our workshop series is really just starting out. 

26
00:02:48,03 --> 00:02:54,00
We had our first session in April with Dr. Michelle Caswell from UCLA’s Information Studies department 

27
00:02:54,03 --> 00:02:58,00
to kick off the series with an introduction to critical race theory. 

28
00:02:58,03 --> 00:03:05,00
The session was well-received with over 75 attendees and much appreciation for the opportunity. 

29
00:03:05,03 --> 00:03:14,00
We’re excited for our next session in May with Dr. Esther Ohito from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Education (Go Heels!) 

30
00:03:14,03 --> 00:03:18,00
to talk about critical pedagogies and anti-racist teaching. 

31
00:03:18,03 --> 00:03:24,00
I’m particularly excited for this mix of experts inside and outside of Library and Information Studies. 

32
00:03:24,03 --> 00:03:31,00
And, we’re hopeful that these sessions will provide opportunities for us to discuss anti-racist instruction in our institutional setting 

33
00:03:31,03 --> 00:03:40,00
and consider theoretically and practically how we can implement changes in our own library instruction as well as ways to improve our instruction program.

34
00:03:40,03 --> 00:03:44,00
[SLIDE 6] I’m hopeful that we’ll be able to continue the workshop series beyond June,

35
00:03:44,03 --> 00:03:51,00
though we’ll certainly check-in as we go to make sure that the workshops are providing the skill-building opportunities 

36
00:03:51,03 --> 00:03:57,00
that our library instructors need and to make sure that the workshops are meeting our programmatic goals. 

37
00:03:57,03 --> 00:04:03,00
If anyone has any suggested speakers or wants to be one of our speakers, I’m happy to hear from you all. 

38
00:04:03,03 --> 00:04:14,00
So far, we have received some feedback about making the workshops available beyond UCLA Library either synchronously or through recordings. 

39
00:04:14,03 --> 00:04:23,00
In order to create space for open discussion and dialogue and to specifically center UCLA Library as our context and in framing our solutions, 

40
00:04:24,03 --> 00:04:29,00
we hadn’t planned on opening them up further or on making recordings available. 

41
00:04:29,03 --> 00:04:39,00
In the future, we might explore other opportunities to open up avenues for discussion and engagement on anti-racist pedagogy beyond UCLA Library.

42
00:04:39,03 --> 00:04:48,00
[SLIDE 7] If there are any questions or comments, you can email me at my Library email address (mattweirick@library.ucla.edu) 

43
00:04:48,03 --> 00:04:43,00
or my personal professional email address (matt@mattweirick.com). 

44
00:04:43,03 --> 00:05:00,00
This recording, along with the slides, captions, and transcript, will be available on my website (academic.mattweirick.com) 

45
00:05:00,03 --> 00:05:05,00
if anyone would like to access the materials later. Thanks again.
