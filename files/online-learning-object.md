<h3>The Search Process</h3>

In the library, we often use databases to find academic sources, generally in the form of research articles. The library has access to a variety of databases centering on different topics or subjects or searching for different types of materials. 

In this activity, you'll practice searching for academic research articles using the library website and available databases. You'll also observe the difference between searching the Library Engine from the library's main page and searching a database, in this case Academic Search Ultimate. 

To begin, we need to choose a topic. For this exercise, you can choose any topic that might be of interest to you; it could end up being the topic for your final paper, or it could just be a fun and interesting topic. If you're having trouble thinking of topics, here are a few examples: drag racing, vegetarianism, bullying, hurricanes, GMOs, intimate partner violence, self-driving cards, machine learning, algorithms, sustainable development, change management. 

You'll notice that these topic examples are short and broad. You'll work on narrowing the topic through the search process, and you'll continue to revise your topic as you realize what academic sources are available and as you learn more about the topic.
