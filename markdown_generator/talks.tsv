1	The Writing Partners Program: A Case Study of ELL Students and Beginning Coaches	conference panel	writing-partners	International Writing Centers Association Conference	2015-10-09	"Pittsburgh, PA"	https://academic.mattweirick.com/files/2015-10-09-writing-partners.pdf	"In a 1990 Writing Center Journal piece, Muriel Harris paused over the term &quot;writing center,&quot; wondering if we even know what a writing center actually is given that centers have evolved in very different institutions to serve different needs at different time periods in our history. Twenty-five years later, this pan-el asks much the same question: Who Do We Think We Are? That is, what is a writing center to those students and faculty who use it, to administrations that hire personnel and create job descriptions, and even to Writing Studies as that discipline has changed over time. Currently, for example, Writing Studies encompasses fields as varied as Writing in the Disciplines and translingual or global language theories. In addition, though many writing centers continue to be housed in English departments, the field is witnessing a growing trend to place one-on-one writing instruction in academic support centers, disci-pline-specific centers, and learning commons. The question, then, of who we think we are is wrapped up in its corollary question: Who do others think we are? Or, to recall what is a perennial writing center question: What do they (our students, our faculty, our institutions) think we do? In an effort to address those questions, this panel reports on four different but related studies."

4	Who Knows What&apos;s Good? Biopolitics, the State, and Health Information Access	conference panel	biopolitics-health-info	SILS Symposium on Information for Social Good	2017-04-21	"Chapel Hill, NC"	http://info4socialgood.web.unc.edu/schedule/	"Focusing on the intersections of health, medical practices, information, and ethics, our panel will discuss the biopolitical mediation between ourselves and propositional wellness. Popularized by Michel Foucault, biopolitics refers to the disciplinary practices targeting governed bodies that control the modes of life. We will interrogate current ethical dilemmas in respect to the withholding of medical intervention for trans youth, reproductive health and care, medical information in prisons, and the legality of advertisements for mental health medications."

6	Toxic Librarianship: An Exploration of Waste and Masculinity (Is That Redundant?) in Libraries	conference panel	toxic-librarianship	SILS Symposium on Information for Social Good	2018-04-13	"Chapel Hill, NC"	http://info4socialgood2018.web.unc.edu/panel-scheduleabstracts/	"Libraries and communities nationwide are plagued by issues of toxicity. In this panel we will examine two widely distinct forms of toxicity that affect us as a society and as information professionals: waste and masculinity The first presentation, on toxic waste, will discuss the intentional poisoning of marginalized communities by industrial polluters and will present library centric solutions to providing information and legal assistance to those affected. While the second presentation will discuss toxic masculinity in libraries through various theories, including masculine overcompensation theory, theories of horizontal sex segregation, organizational theories, and theories of care work (such as devaluation)."
