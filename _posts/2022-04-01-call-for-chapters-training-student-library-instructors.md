# About the Books
Librarians are increasingly expected to provide instruction as part of their job responsibilities. Repeated reviews of librarian job ads have shown increases in instructional responsibilities or an expectation of instruction as a core responsibility for librarians (Lynch & Smith, 2001; Sproles & Ratledge, 2004; Sproles & Detmering, 2012). In Dodd's (2013) survey of supervisors, 87% reported that library instruction was very important in their libraries. Additionally, they noted that assisting other instructors, on-the-job training, in-house training programs, and observing other instructors were the best ways to prepare a new librarian to do instruction. However, often library school students and early career librarians receive little or no formal teacher training in their graduate programs, from work experiences during grad school, or in their professional roles. 

These two edited volumes, to be published by ACRL Press, will outline case studies and best practices for developing and delivering teacher training for students and early-career librarians in academic libraries and LIS graduate programs. 

These two volumes intend to situate the impetus for training student instructors. They will
- explore why teacher training is important in LIS graduate programs and academic libraries,
- provide case studies and examples with detailed resources regarding the development,
delivery, and assessment of library instruction training in academic libraries and
graduate programs, 
- present effective and successful partnerships that leverage student instructors, and
- contribute critical reflections from student workers and early career librarians to
provide important context for designing student-centered initiatives.

Each volume will be separated into three general sections:
- Theory, Practice, and Need
- Case Studies
- Learner Reflections & Perspectives

## Training Student Library Instructors, Vol 1: A Guide for LIS Faculty &amp; Graduate Programs
The first volume will focus on integrating teacher training in graduate programs by LIS faculty. The book will begin with background and a review of relevant literature regarding training in LIS curricula, followed by case studies with practical examples of effective training in LIS programs and case studies of LIS faculty collaborating with partners on or off campus to provide training for students. The volume will close with reflections and perspectives from graduate students and early-career librarians with or without instruction training in their LIS programs. 

## Training Student Library Instructors, Vol 2: A Guide for Librarians &amp; Academic Libraries
The second volume will focus on training student library instructors in academic libraries through training programs, on-the-job training, or other mechanisms. The book will begin with a framing of the need for training library student workers to teach and the value of peer-to-peer teaching & learning initiatives. This will be followed by case studies of how librarians and academic libraries have incorporated instruction training for their student workers or early-career librarians to prepare them for instructional duties and case studies exploring collaborations for peer-to-peer teaching opportunities. The volume will close with reflections and perspectives from graduate students and early-career librarians about their experiences with on-the-job training or in-house training programs in academic libraries as student workers or early-career librarians.

# Call for Chapter Proposals
These edited volumes will present case studies for training library school students or student workers to provide instruction. Each chapter should provide background and context for the case and include relevant and specific information that a colleague would need to initiate a similar program, course, collaboration, etc. Chapters will be separated into two volumes, which will include sections for (1) theory, practice, and need, (2) case studies, and (3) learner reflections and perspectives. Case studies will likely be separated into those that discuss a particular program, course, or approach to training and those that discuss partnering or collaborating to engage learners in practical teaching experiences. 

## Chapters related to theory, practice, and need may take any of the following approaches or others as relevant:
- a review of current literature on library school programs and curricula or on-the-job training in libraries
- an overview of the need for and value of peer-to-peer teaching & learning initiatives in libraries perhaps as related to other peer-to-peer library services
- a content analysis of job ads 
- a content analysis of LIS syllabi
- an analysis of current LIS program offerings
- a survey of recent library school graduates or early-career librarians about how prepared they felt to do library instruction or what preparation they received in library school or on the job

## A few potential ideas for case studies are provided below: 
- a practice or workflow for student workers or library school students to shadow librarians providing instruction
- an in-house training program for student workers and/or early-career librarians to learn about teaching & learning
- a course or curriculum in a graduate program dedicated to teaching & learning, user education, information literacy, library instruction, etc.
- a collaboration between a faculty member and a library or librarians to provide hands-on experience providing library instruction in any library setting
- a professional development program or other training opportunity that introduces people to concepts related to teaching & learning, information literacy, etc. 

## Chapters for learner reflections and perspectives may touch on any of the following topics, though they need not fit into any of these: 
- experiences with library instruction or information literacy training in library school, on the job as a student worker, or on the job as an early-career librarian and the impact on your work
- lack of training in library school or work and the impact on your work
- approaches to learning about or getting experience with library instruction 
- reflections on any training you have received - what worked well, what didn't, etc. 

If you have an idea for a chapter that you would like to discuss further, please contact me at matt@mattweirick.com <a href="mailto:matt@mattweirick.com"> <i class="fa fa-envelope" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

Library school students and first-time authors are encouraged to submit. Again, please reach out if you have any specific questions or would like to talk through an idea together. I'm happy to provide guidance and mentorship throughout the process from proposal to final draft or to provide support in any other ways that are meaningful and helpful. 

Authors from oppressed and marginalized groups are also encouraged to submit as are authors from any academic setting, including graduate programs, 2-year and 4-year institutions, and HBCUs.
