A broad discussion of the roles of library workers and human resources (HR) workers in the search process and the impact of HR policy on the development, work, happiness, and lives of our new colleagues, with a specific focus on how this impacts early career librarians and recent graduates (especially those without access to institutional knowledge, without experience dealing with human resources employees, and without preparation or support from their library programs related to negotiating with human resources). What does our Library HR currently look like and what is the ideal HR that we envision? How does our HR department define success? How are our goals of supporting new librarians within a division in contrast with HRâ€™s goals of protecting the institution?
