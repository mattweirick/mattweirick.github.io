Libraries and Writing Centers share a commitment to providing writing and digital literacy skills. This session will explore how academic libraries and university writing centers can work together to provide these important skills at public libraries or other venues to support their local community members. As these skills become more necessary for daily life, our institutions should look to fill these roles.
