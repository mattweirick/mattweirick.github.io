Writing across the curriculum (WAC) courses involve assignments in which writing and research are deeply intertwined. But it is often difficult for instructors to anticipate the writing and information literacy skills their assignments require. To address this, UCLA librarians have partnered with writing faculty to create a course planner to help WAC instructors predict an assignmentâ€™s composition and research demands, and devise student-centered activities to address them. This session describes the collaboration that led to the planner and workshops conducted for WAC faculty and TAs, and gives participants opportunities to share similar ideas that are working on their campuses.
