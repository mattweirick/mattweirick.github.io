Our Anti-Racist Pedagogy Workshop Series seeks to invite qualified facilitators and experts to present on anti-racist pedagogy and practice in a series available to all library staff to support anti-racist praxis in teaching & learning in alignment with the Libraryâ€™s overall anti-racism initiative. The Workshop Series is designed and coordinated by UCLA Library's Teaching & Learning Functional Team and focuses on providing scaffolded professional development opportunities specifically related to anti-racism and library instruction. Our inaugural workshop sets the stage with an introduction to critical race theory. The goal of our prolonged engagement is to build depth and move beyond repeated one-off introductory workshops. With support from our Associate University Librarian, Judy Consales, we've been able to fund the workshop series to pay workshop presenters for their time and energy.
