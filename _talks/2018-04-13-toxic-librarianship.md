[Conference Abstract](http://info4socialgood2018.web.unc.edu/panel-scheduleabstracts/)

Libraries and communities nationwide are plagued by issues of toxicity. In this panel we will examine two widely distinct forms of toxicity that affect us as a society and as information professionals: waste and masculinity The first presentation, on toxic waste, will discuss the intentional poisoning of marginalized communities by industrial polluters and will present library centric solutions to providing information and legal assistance to those affected. While the second presentation will discuss toxic masculinity in libraries through various theories, including masculine overcompensation theory, theories of horizontal sex segregation, organizational theories, and theories of care work (such as devaluation).
