Focusing on the intersections of health, medical practices, information, and ethics, our panel will discuss the biopolitical mediation between ourselves and propositional wellness. Popularized by Michel Foucault, biopolitics refers to the disciplinary practices targeting governed bodies that control the modes of life. We will interrogate current ethical dilemmas in respect to the withholding of medical intervention for trans youth, reproductive health and care, medical information in prisons, and the legality of advertisements for mental health medications.
