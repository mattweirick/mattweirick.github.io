I am a professional librarian (in that I have an MSLS) and freelance photographer (in that I have a Canon EOS 6D Mark II. I'm interested in academic library instruction, information literacies (e.g. digital, personal health, sexual health, other health), and health information behavior, especially as enacted on dating applications.

I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with an MSLS in May 2018 and have been searching for employment in an academic library setting.
