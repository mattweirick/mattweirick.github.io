In  summer  2020,  the  authors  collaborated  on  the  fifth  iteration  of  the  Mellon  Mays Undergraduate Fellowship (MMUF) Summer Writing and Research Train-ing Program (WRTP). The program is intended to support writing and research skills  development  for  BIPOC,  LGBTQIA,  and  disabled  student  researchers  in-terested in pursuing careers in academia. Our chapter details the history of the program, elaborates on the extensive campus partnerships involved in its success, and provides reflections and best practices around program coordination, cultur-ally responsive pedagogy, student experience outside the classroom, and remote instruction to help others establish similar programs at their institutions. In par-ticular,  we  explore  the  necessary  structures  to  create  a  sustainable  and  flexible  program that has continued successfully for several years while also accounting for changing student needs, changes in personnel, historical events like protests and the pandemic, and a shift from offering the program in-person to online.
